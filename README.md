# Full stack Code Interview

## Run the client
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
```bash
cd ./client
npm run start
```

## Run the server
No configurations for the node server, just move to the directory.
```bash
cd server
```
You will create your own way to run your Node.js server, [don't forget to have Node.js installed](https://nodejs.org/en/).
